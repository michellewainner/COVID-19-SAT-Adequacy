    "The SAT has continually come into question as an appropriate measure of student intelligence and college readiness, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic. Disputes amongst organizations have called for and against its use in high schools, with nearly 90 percent of the nation's bachelors degree-granting institutions becoming test-optional or \"test blind\" in 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, is the SAT an adequate measure of student intelligence, such that students--who exhibit interest in pursuing math-oriented majors--demonstrate higher math section SAT scores? Likewise, is this interest and perceived academic proficiency in English also reflected in students' English reading/writing section SAT scores? Moreover, how have these SAT metrics changed in the past eight years, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated significant impacts on a variety SAT metrics, including score and intended college major decisions, that were both immediate and long term. Furthermore, findings indicate an overall bias favoring English scores, regardless of major orientation, though this bias is slightly ameliorated in math-oriented majors. As a result, the SAT may not be an adequate measure of student intelligence as it relates to math-oriented fields, but may be a positive indicator of proficiency in English-oriented fields. Changes to the SAT math section as well as high school math curricula are critical in order to realign the test's content to students' academic abilities."
